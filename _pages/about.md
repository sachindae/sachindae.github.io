I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Amazon Music, and am especially passionate about artifical intelligence. My primary research interests are music-related tasks 
and the intersection of computer vision and NLP. While in school, I worked with [Prof. Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and 
[Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on zero-shot learning for vision by using large language models. Additionally,
I worked with [Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on optical music recognition, which can be described as OCR for music.

Previously, I have worked at SpaceX and interned at Amazon, NVIDIA and mCube, and received my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from UC
San Diego.
