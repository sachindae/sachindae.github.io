I'm a 1st-year Masters student studying Computer Science at UC San Diego. My primary research interests are the intersection of 
computer vision and NLP, as well as applications of deep learning to music-related tasks. All my work on vision and langauge is jointly
advised by [Prof. Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and [Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/). Additionally,
I have been working with [Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on optical music recognition.

Previously, I have interned at NVIDIA and mCube, and received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UC
San Diego.
