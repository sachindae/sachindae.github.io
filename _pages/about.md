I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Annapurna Labs working on LLM inference acceleration for AWS Trainium chips.

While in school, I worked with [Prof. Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and 
[Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on zero-shot learning for vision by using large language models. Additionally, I worked with [Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on optical music recognition, which can be described as OCR for music.

Previously, I have worked at Amazon and SpaceX, and interned at NVIDIA, and received my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from UC San Diego.
