I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Annapurna Labs working on accelerating LLM inference for AWS Trainium chips.

Previously, I have worked at Amazon Music and SpaceX, and interned at NVIDIA, and received my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from UC San Diego. 

While in school, I worked with [Prof. Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and 
[Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on zero-shot learning for vision by using large language models, and optical music recognition, which can be described as OCR for music.
