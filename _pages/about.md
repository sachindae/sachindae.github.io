I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UC San Diego, and will be starting my Masters at UCSD in Fall 2021.
My primary research interests are the intersection of computer vision and NLP, as well as applications of deep learning to music-related tasks.

Currently I'm working with [Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on optical music recognition as part
of the CSE Honors Program at UCSD.
