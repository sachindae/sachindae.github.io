I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at UC San Diego, and will be starting a Masters program in Fall.
My primary research interests are computer vision and applications of deep learning for music-related tasks.

Currently I'm working with [Prof. Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) on optical music recognition as part
of the CSE Honors Program at UCSD.
